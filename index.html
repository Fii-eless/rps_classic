        <h1>Break Your Tie</h1>
        <div class="smallTalk">
            <p>To do or not to do? Do you have to choose between either? The guilt of the consequences of a random choice should not be on you. 
            The gods invented Rock-Paper-Scissors to deal with that</p>
            <h3>Let this be your guide:</h3>
            <p>If you are here, then you have a choice to make between two options. As a matter of caution, be sure that both options are equally weighted
                and choosing either would not result in significant greater or worse consequences. 
                Or maybe, you are completely lost as to what is the right choice and must pick one anyway, despite the outcome. This is how we will play:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assign your win/loss to a particular outcome. Eg, if I win, I do option A or vice versa</li>
                    <li>You will play 5 rounds of games, not counting ties</li>
                    <li>In the end, you make the real-life choice, based on the results the gods give you</li>
                </ul>
                If you are satisfied with these, go on and start playing.
