The classic game of rock, paper, scissors; settling disputes longer than the courts!
For now, it will be played in the console; later will give a graphic interface on the html page.
Same rules: rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper.
There is no need for a specialized skill other than the skill of 'luck', as computer's choice will be randomly generated.
