The classic game of rock, paper, scissors; settling disputes longer than the courts!
For now, it will be played in the console; later will give a graphic interface on the html page.
Same rules: rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, scissors cuts paper.
There is no need for a specialized skill other than the skill of 'luck', as computer's choice will be randomly generated.
After a lot of sweat, blood and tears, over 20 days after I set out to write this "Simple" game, it is all done.
I first created the playGame function, that plays a single round of the game - easy.
Next, i defined a function that invites you to play the game.
I should not have tried to put the function to call 5 rounds of play in the playGame.
Eventually everything worked fine when I defined a function to call 5 rounds, then put PlayGame and scores inside that

What I learned:
syntax can easily be googled, algorithm, not so much.
calling your functions in the right places is just as important as defining right function.
I still know very little. Haha. Let's work on changing that, shall we?
